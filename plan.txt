**1. SQL Server Integration
**1.1. Storing Image Metadata:

Database Tables: Use SQL Server to store metadata about your images. For instance, store URLs or paths to images along with any relevant data (e.g., user profiles or cabin details).
Example Table Schema:

sql
Copy code
CREATE TABLE UserImages (
    UserId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ImageUrl NVARCHAR(MAX)
);

CREATE TABLE CabinImages (
    CabinId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ImageUrl NVARCHAR(MAX)
);
**1.2. Storing Image URLs:

Image URLs: Store the URLs or paths of images in SQL Server. These URLs will point to where the images are stored in cloud storage (e.g., Firebase Storage or Supabase Storage).
Example Insert Statement:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO UserImages (UserId, ImageUrl)
VALUES (1, 'https://your-storage-url/user-images/1/profile.jpg');
**2. Frontend Integration
**2.1. Static Assets:

Logo: As previously mentioned, include static assets like logos directly in your frontend project. This approach is independent of your backend storage solution.
**2.2. Dynamic Images:

Fetching URLs: Fetch image URLs from SQL Server via your API endpoints and use them in your frontend to display user and cabin images.
Example API Response:

json
Copy code
{
  "user": {
    "id": 1,
    "profilePicture": "https://your-storage-url/user-images/1/profile.jpg"
  }
}
Example Frontend Display:

jsx
Copy code
const UserProfile = ({ user }) => (
  <div>
    <img src={user.profilePicture} alt="Profile" />
  </div>
);
**3. Workflow
Upload Images: Upload images to a cloud storage service (Firebase, Supabase).
Store URLs: Save the image URLs or paths in SQL Server.
Frontend: Fetch these URLs from your backend API and use them in your frontend to display images.
Static Files: Keep static assets like logos in your frontend build directory.
Benefits
Scalability: Cloud storage services are designed to handle large volumes of images and provide efficient delivery through CDNs.
Separation of Concerns: SQL Server handles structured data, while cloud storage manages unstructured data (images).
Performance: Combining cloud storage for images and SQL Server for data ensures that each part of your application is optimized for its specific role.
By using SQL Server for database management and a cloud storage service for images, you leverage the strengths of each technology without conflict.
